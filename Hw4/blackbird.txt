Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly
is if in it or ip on are
All your life You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
